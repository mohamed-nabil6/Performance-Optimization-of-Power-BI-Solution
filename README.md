# Performance Optimization of Power BI Solution

  - Performance Optimization in Your Data Model

## Objective:
- Transform flat files into a star schema to significantly enhance the performance and scalability of an existing Power BI solution. This improvement ensures faster data processing and accommodates growing data volumes efficiently.

## Key Improvements

### Data Modelling
- Built robust table relationships and designed a star schema to streamline data processing and improve query performance.

### Performance Optimization
- Created the index numbers instead of using customer IDs as text to speed up queries and improve app performance. This approach leverages the efficiency of numeric fields in storage, processing speed, and query execution.

## ðŸŒŸUsing numeric IDs instead of text IDs in a data model can significantly improve performance and efficiency. Here are some reasons why numeric IDs are preferred:

### Database and Model Optimization
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Many database engines and BI tools are optimized for numeric operations, meaning they can perform more efficiently on numeric data types.

### Processing Speed
- **Join Operations**: When performing joins between tables, using numeric keys can significantly speed up the process as numeric comparisons are faster than string comparisons.
- **Aggregations and Calculations**: Operations such as aggregations and calculations are faster on numeric fields compared to text fields.

### Performance and Storage Efficiency
- **Storage Size**: Numeric fields generally require less storage space compared to text fields. For instance, an integer field takes up 4 bytes of storage, whereas a text field can take up much more depending on the length of the text.
- **Indexing Speed**: Numeric fields are faster to index. Indexes created on numeric fields consume less storage and are quicker to read and write compared to text indexes.
- **Query Execution**: Queries involving numeric fields are executed faster than those involving text fields. This is because numerical comparisons and operations are computationally less intensive than string comparisons.

### Memory Usage
- **Memory Efficiency**: Numeric fields use less memory than text fields, which can lead to more efficient memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Data Integrity and Consistency
- **Uniqueness and Simplicity**: Numeric IDs ensure uniqueness and are simple to generate. They avoid issues like case sensitivity and leading/trailing spaces that can occur with text fields.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Numeric fields maintain a consistent format, whereas text fields might have variations (e.g., "123" vs. "00123") that can lead to inconsistencies.
  
### Optimized DAX Measures
- Developed and optimized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures and calculations.
- Ensured efficient use of resources.
